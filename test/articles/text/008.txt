¯ We discuss T -odd correlations between jet and lepton momenta in tt events at the Tevatron that can be used to search for CP violation. We identify correlations suitable for the lepton plus jets and purely hadronic top-quark pair decay channels. As an example of CP violation we consider the top-quark anomalous couplings, including its chromo-electric dipole moment, and we estimate the limits that can be placed at the Tevatron.
